This project is designed to facilitate the  deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application. By leveraging modern technologies such as Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), this project aims to streamline the entire software development lifecycle.

## Overview

The MERN DevOps project includes:

- **Dockerization**: Building and running containers for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` and YAML configurations.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating the build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins.

## Documentation

To understand the various components of this project, refer to the following documentation:

- **[Docker.md](./docs/Docker.md)**: Detailed instructions on how to build and run the MERN stack application using Docker, including creating a Docker network, building images, and managing containers.

- **[Kubernetes.md](./docs/Kubernetes.md)**: Detailed instructions on deploying the MERN stack application using Kubernetes, including how to set up persistent storage, deploy services, and access the application.

- **[Jenkins.md](./docs/Jenkins.md)**: A comprehensive guide on the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, outlining the various stages, parameters, prerequisites, and tools used to automate the integration and deployment processes.
